In the case of an OS that supports native NPEM but not _DSM, I think
it would be unreasonable for NPEM to stop working just because a new
firmware release added the _DSM.

If a device and its parent both advertise NPEM, I dunno how to figure
out which to use.  Maybe that's a benefit that could come with the
_DSM.
