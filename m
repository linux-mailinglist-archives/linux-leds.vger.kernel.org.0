Is there any chance you would accept drive status LEDs using the LED 
subsystem, if the driver was rewritten to represent each possible drive 
state as a single led_classdev device, each with no special attributes, 
just brightness of 0 or 1?

The drive states are logically each displaying one bit of information to 
the user, and each could actually be physically represented by a 
physical LED (though probably not).  I only combined them into a single 
led_classdev device with an extra attribute because I thought it made 
more sense to do so, but it sounds like I might have made a bad choice 
in doing so.

In support of using the LED subsystem for this--there are other LEDs in 
linux which aren't necessarily always represented by single physical 
LEDs, such as "caps lock" for keyboards.  Virtual consoles display 
keyboard indicators as text in a window rather than an LED--and someone 
_could_ make a weird keyboard that displays the 3 bits of 
caps/scroll/number lock info as a decimal number on a display.  My point 
is that it seems to me that the LED subsystem is already being used for 
things that logically display a bit of information to the user, which 
may or may not be represented by a single LED.  (Ethernet port LEDs are 
another possible example--they might combine link present, link speed, 
and activity all on one LED, by using different colors and flashing 
patterns.)
