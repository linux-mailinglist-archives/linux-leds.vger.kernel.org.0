Just use a single segment-gpios property?
The dot is optional, and can be zero.
The number of characters is (the number of elements + 1) / 8.
The "+ 1" serves to accommodate the optional dot for the last character,
but if people find that too complicated, you can enforce a multiple
of 8 instead.

The colon found on many 4-digit displays can be a separate gpios
property.

I do agree subnodes could be more appropriate for more complex
displays, but ideally you need some way to describe relative positions
for such displays, too.

Note that most larger displays are not individual LEDs, but matrices
of LEDs. Do we want to drive/scan them from software, using a
gpio-7seg-matrix driver?
