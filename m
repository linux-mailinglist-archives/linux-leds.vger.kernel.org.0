My quick writeup:

New sysfs entires:
- mode: single_zone_static, multi_zone_static, single_zone_breathing, 
multi_zone_breathing, single_zone_color_cycle, multi_zone_color_cycle, etc.
     - single_zone_static is mandatory, all other modes are optional (maybe even 
freely definable by the driver)
     - single_zone_static is the default and does not add any new sysfs entries 
that aren't already present on multicolor leds aka brightness, max_brightness, 
multi_index, mulit_intensity
     - multi_zone_static adds a new entry zones_count. mulit_intensity has now 
colors count * zones_count entries. aka a rgb keyboard with 126 leds would take 
378 values for mulit_intensity
     - other modes are more device specific e.g.
         - multi_zone_breathing could have optional breathing_speed and 
max_breathing speed entries depending on whether or not the hardware supports it.
         - multi_zone_color_cycle could have a color_count and max_color_count 
entry. e.g. with color_count 2 you would then write 756 values to multi 
intensity, describing 2 states the driver should alternate between

Every multi_zone_* mode could also output a zones_image. That is a greyscale 
bitmap or even a svg containing the information where each zone is located and 
which outline it has. For the bitmap the information would be encoded in the 
grey value, aka 0 = zone 0 etc with 0xff = no zone (i.e. space between the 
keys). For the svg, the name of the paths would indicate the zone they are 
describing. Svg would have the advantage that it could be more easily used to 
also describe non square devices like mice or headsets that also might have 
complex RGB controllers.

This might already be doable with triggers? I'm unsure of triggers allow to 
change the length of multi_intensity however.

Looking into it, thanks for the direction. But this would come with the downside 
that upowers kbd_brightness no longer controls the keyboard.

Another approach could be that i implement what i described under 
multi_zone_static above without the zones_count entry. Then there wouldn't be 
126 unrelated files, but a multi_intensity that is describing multiple 3 subled 
leds. This would at least solve the performance problem and allow the shared 
brightness adjust the hardware supports to be implemented.

No, it's for the integrated keyboards in some of our devices, this driver 
specifically is for the Stellaris line with optomechanical keyboards. The ite 
controller is internally connected, but is using the usb protocol.
