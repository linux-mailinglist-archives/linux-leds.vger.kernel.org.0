Is there a different/better way to control per-device LEDs?  (I'm
thinking of something like my NAS, which has 5 drive bays, each with
its own activity LED.)

To be slightly flippant, why not?  "Userspace" in this case is the
system/device administrator.  They presumably know what LEDs they have
and what they want to use them for, something which the kernel cannot
know (assuming a "generic" disto kernel).

It would certainly be possible to impose a limit on the number of
triggers that could be created.  But then someone has to decide what
that limit should be.  Personally, I lean very much toward giving the
system administrator the freedom to configure their system as they see
fit, even if that means that they can break it.  (Where "break"
basically means that they need to reboot.)

Would adding a prefix to the LED trigger name address your concern
about arbitrary names and potential conflicts?  I.e. the system
administrator creates a block device LED trigger named "foo", and it
shows up as an LED trigger named "blkdev:foo" (or something like that).

How would you support multiple, per-device LEDs (the NAS use case above)
in this scheme?

Is there a reason that you prefer this approach to simply having the
block layer "fire" the trigger?

Thanks for the feedback!
