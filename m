So, "it never works" means there is no bug. Now, what we need is to
keep the same enumeration scheme, but if you wish to be used half/half
(or any other ratio), the driver should do like the above mentioned
PWM, i.e. register entire space and depending on the requestor either
proceed with a line or mark it as BUSY.

Ideally, looking into what the chip can do, this should be indeed
converted to some like pin control + PWM + LED + GPIO drivers. Then
the function in pin mux configuration can show what exactly is enabled
on the certain line(s).
