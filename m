Yes that is true.

I prefer to keep the examples in the leds-class-multicolor.rst.

This is an ABI document not a document describing the code.

I updated the doc to what you have above.

I would rather point to the file that contains the colors.Â  This way we 
don't have added documentation

maintenance to add a new color.
