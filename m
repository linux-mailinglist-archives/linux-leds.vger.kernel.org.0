TBH I didn't look at the OpenRGB code yet and LampArray there is currently only 
planned. I somewhat hope that until the kernel driver is ready someone else 
already picked up implementing LampArray in OpenRGB.

My first thought here also: What is if something else is reading hidraw devices?

Especially for hidraw devices that are not just LampArray.

I think a read-only mode is not part of the current led class UAPI. Also I don't 
want to associate AutonomousMode=true with led class is used. 
AutonomousMode=true could for example mean that it is controlled via keyboard 
shortcuts that are directly handled in the keyboard firmware, aka a case where 
you want neither OpenRGB nor led class make any writes to the keyboard.

Or AutonomousMode=true could mean that on a device that implements both a 
LampArray interface as well as a proprietary legacy interface is currently 
controlled via the proprietary legacy interface (a lot of which are supported by 
OpenRGB).

Werner
