Hei hei,

these are the not yet taken patches from a series which originally fixed
a minor issue in the leds pwm driver, then migrated the leds pwm dts
docs to yaml (by request), and then fixed all the dts files triggering
warnings on those new bindings.  The remaining five patches now only fix
warnings, the base fix and the yaml conversion is already taken by
subsystem maintainers.  Although this is only dts content now, I rebased
it on the current for-next tree of the leds subsystem maintainer,
because that contains the yaml-conversion changeset.

Series changelog below …
