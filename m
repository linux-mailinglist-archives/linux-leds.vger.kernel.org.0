Hi Werner,

RGB stuff is not at all standardized and every vendor is doing completely different interfaces, which does not fit the kernel userpsace apis desire to be uniformal and fixed. e.g. Auxdisplay might fit static setting of RGB values, but it does not fit the snake-effect mode, or the raindrops mode, or the 4-different-colors-in-the-edges-breathing-and-color-cycling mode.

Yes.

Hmm, the problem here is that leaving a non-working LED class device
behind may confuse things like upower.

So maybe the disable_kbd_backlight_support sysfs attr should
not sit under /sys/class/leds/foobar::kbd_backlight, but rather
it should sit under the sysfs dir of the parent-device ?

So if we are talking [USB|I2C]-HID keyboards and userspace
using hidraw to takeover kbd_backlight control through,
then have "disable_kbd_backlight_support" sit under
/sys/bus/hid/devices/0003:xxxx:xxxx.xxxx/disable_kbd_backlight_support

and then re-register the LED class device for the keyboard
when 0 gets written to disable_kbd_backlight_support ?

That seems better to me then leaving a non-working LED
class device behind and this will not require any changes
to the LED subsystem.

See above, I think we need to put the sysfs-attr to disable
the kernel's builtin kbd-backlight support in the parents
sysfs-dir and then actually unregister the LED class device,
this way we don't need any LED subsytem changes at all.

>>> - I guess UPower integration for the userspace driver could be archived with https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/leds/uleds.html however this limited to brightness atm, so when accent colors actually come to UPower this would also need some expansion to be able to pass a preferred color to the userspace driver (regardless of what that driver is then doing with that information).

Right, that can be done with some custom sysfs attr added
to the LED class device, like how dell-laptop.c sets
the .groups member of the "dell::kbd_backlight"
"struct led_classdev kbd_led" to add some extra
sysfs_attr to configure the timeout after which
the kbd_backlight automatically turns off when
no keys are pressed.

> Also it would be nice to be able to set the whole keyboard with a singular file access so that the keyboard changes at once and not zone by zone.

That is an interesting point. This could be implemented
by adding an "enable_atomic_commit" sysfs attr to
all 4:

   :rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-left
   :rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-middle
   :rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-right
   :rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-wasd

LED class devices, which is backed by only
1 variable in the kernel (so changing it
in one place changes it everywhere) and
then also have a "commit" sysfs attr and
writing say "1" to that will then commit
all changes at once.

So normally changes are still applied directly
(for compatibility with the usual sysfs API),
but then when "enable_atomic_commit" is set to 1,
writes only update in kernel variables and then
once "commit" is written all changes are send
out in 1 go.

I think we had the same issue where there was
a single WMI call to change all zones at once
(and having some sort of atomic API was desirable)
the last time the suggestion to use 4 LED class
devices for zoned kbds:

   :rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-left
   :rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-middle
   :rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-right
   :rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-wasd

came up, so we could start a new:

Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-led-zoned-kbd-backlight

document extending the standard:

Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-led

which documents both using the:

   :rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-left
   :rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-middle
   :rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-right
   :rgb:kbd_zoned_backlight-wasd

suffixes there, as well as document some sort
of atomically change all 4 zones at once API.

Werner, if this sounds like something which would
work for you, then it would probably be best to
first submit a RFC patch introducing a:

Documentation/ABI/testing/sysfs-class-led-zoned-kbd-backlight

and then first discuss that with the LED subsys
maintainers, so that we have buy-in from the LED
subsys maintainers before you start actually
implementing this.

I'll reply to your "I also stumbled across a new Problem"
in another reply as it seems best to start a separate
thread for this.

Regards,

Hans
