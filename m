Patch series introducing support for ROHM BD71828 PMIC

ROHM BD71828 is a power management IC containing 7 bucks and 7 LDOs. All
regulators can either be controlled individually via I2C. Bucks 1,2,6 and
7 can also be assigned to a "regulator group" controlled by run-levels.
Eg. Run level specific voltages and enable/disable statuses for each of
these bucks can be set via register interface. The buck run-level group
assignment (selection if buck is to be controlled individually or via
run-levels) can be changed at run-time via I2C.

Run level changes can then be initiated wither via I2C writes or GPIO.
and when run-level is changed, state of all bucks which are set to be
controlled via run-levels are changed accrdingly.

This control mechanism selection (I2C or GPIO) is selected by data in
one time programmable PMIC memory area (during production) and can't be
changed later.

In addition to the bucks and LDOs there are:

- The usual clk gate
- 4 IO pins (mostly usable as GPO or tied to specific purpose)
- power button support
- RTC
- two LEDs
- battery charger
- HALL sensor input

This patch series adds support to regulators, clk, RTC, GPIOs and LEDs.
Power-supply driver for charger is "under construction" and not included
in this RFC series.

Reason for RFC status is the regulator grouping to run-levels. I don't
know what would be the best way to do what patches 8,9 and 10 intend to
provide. (Sure some of this is visible also patches 2 and 3 which
provide dt binding documents.) All suggestions are welcome. Rest of the
patches should be business as usual.

Changelog v2: Mainly RTC and GPIO fixes suggested by Alexandre and Bartosz.
	      LED changes are still under discussion and not included in
	      this version.
  General
    -Patch ordering changed to provide dt binding documents right after the
     MFD core.
  DT-Bindings for regulators (Patch 3)
    -Fix typo in PMIC model number
  RTC (patch 11)
    -Reverted renaming in order to reduce patch size.
    -Reworded commit message
  BD71828 regulator (patch 7)
    -Add MODULE_ALIAS
  GPIO (patch 12)
    -Remove file-name from comment
    -prefix IN and OUT defines with chip type
    -improved documentation for the INPUT only pin.
    -removed empty left-over function
    -removed unnecessary #ifdef CONFIG_OF_GPIO
    -removed unnecessary error print
    -Add MODULE_ALIAS

Patch 1:
        BD71828 MFD core.
Patch 2:
	dt-bindings for BD71828 PMIC
Patch 3:
        dt-bindings for regulators on BD71828 PMIC
Patch 4:
	Power button support using GPIO keys.
Patch 5:
        CLK gate support using existing clk-bd718x7
Patch 6:
        Split existing bd718x7 regulator driver to generic ROHM dt
        parsing portion (used by more than one ROHM drivers) and
        bd718x8 specific parts
Patch 7:
        Basic regulator support (individual control via I2C). This
        should be pretty standard stuff.
Patch 8:
        Add support for getting regulator voltages when GPIO controlled
        run-levels are used. Allow specifying voltages for run-levels
        via DT. Allow controlling run-levels via sysfs entries (I am not
        happy about this. Probably should only provide in-kernel API for
        this or is there better ideas? Showing can be done vis sysfs?
        Debugfs?)
Patch 9:
        Support setting/getting run-levels when they are controlled via
        I2C instead of GPIO. Add in-kernel API for settin run-level
        voltages for regulators at run-time.
Patch 10:
        Add in-kernel APIs for changing the RUN-level. Safer than sysfs
        I guess. But is there some better method for controlling this
        kind of dynamic group of regulators?
Patch 11:
        Support BD71828 RTC block using BD70528 RTC driver
Patch 12:
        Allow control of GP(I)O pins on BD71828 via GPIO subsystem
Patch 13:
        Support toggling the LEDs

This patch series is based on v5.3-rc4
