I think I found a solution!

As Michael suggested, I tried raw register reads and writes, to eliminate any
side effects of the intermediate code. I didn't use the ioctls (this isn't a
netdev), but I found regmap's debugfs write functionality, which allowed me to
do the same.

I was trying to reproduce the behaviour I reported earlier, but couldn't. The
output levels were always the intended ones. At some point I realised that the
regmap_update_bits function does a read-modify-write, which might shadow the
actual current output value.
For example:
 * Set output low: current out is low
 * Change to input with pull-up: current out is still low, but DATAx reads high
 * Set output high: RMW reads a high value (the input), so assumes a write is
   not necessary, leaving the old output value (low).

Currently, I see two options:
 * Use regmap_update_bits_base to avoid the lazy RMW behaviour
 * Add a cache for the output data values to the driver, and only use these
   values to write to the output registers. This would allow keeping lazy RMW
   behaviour, which may be a benefit on slow busses.

With either of these implemented, if I set the output value before the
direction, everything works! :-)

Would you like this to be added to regmap-gpio, or should I revert back to a
device-specific implementation?


Best,
Sander
