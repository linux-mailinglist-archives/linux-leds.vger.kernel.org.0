We do, gpio.yaml in dtschema. We just didn't reference it in all
controllers because at the time unevaluatedProperties didn't
exist/work and you still have to list most properties to define their
constraints. In general, we reference the common schema for ones with
child nodes, but not ones which are just #foo-cells and other
properties. For GPIO, it's evolved to the point that referencing the
common schema makes sense mainly because we have the hog nodes now.

I said before we still need '#trigger-source-cells' in each schema,
but really I suppose if we just set it to 1 or 2 cells in the common
schema, that would be good enough. It's so rarely used. I expect
(because there's discussions on it) someday jsonschema will support
data dependent schemas (i.e. if the value of prop is X, then apply
schema). Actually, we can do that already with if/then schemas, but it
would be kind of verbose.

No need to split them just for that:

dependencies:
  '#trigger-source-cells': interrupt-controller

Though maybe a split makes sense anyways.
