Hi!

And now we have custom interface. Undocumented.

That is not acceptable, sorry.

Find a way to squeeze it into current RGB framework, perhaps with
reduced feature set.

AFAICT you could either pretend it is 2-LED driver with full 8bit RGB
on each, or you could pretend it is 12-LED driver with 1bit
RGB. Select one and implement that.

Best regards,
