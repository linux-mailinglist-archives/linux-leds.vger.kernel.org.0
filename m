Marek -

Thanks for taking the time to look at this.

I'm not unalterably opposed to the idea, but I don't currently see a way
to do that without resolving block devices (struct gendisk) by name, and
that seems to be a no-no.

If you (or anyone else) has a suggestion on how to get around this
obstacle, I'd be willing to give it a shot.

You're correct that it's not possible with the current code.  Multiple
devices can be associated to with a single LED, but there's not
currently a way to drive more than 1 LED from a single device.  This
is something that could be changed.

I wanted to keep things as simple as possible for now.  I don't think
that there's any particular reason that separated LEDs couldn't be
configured for read and write requests.  (It looks like it should be
pretty easy to distinguish reads vs writes in a struct request.)

My feeling is that things like temperature, errors, etc. are better
monitored from user space, as they tend to require actively querying
the drive.

Like you, I'm interested in knowing if there is actually hardware out
there that has separate read/write LEDs.

All in all, I feel like I should be able to implement almost everything
that you've suggested, *if* I can figure out the block device lookup
issue, but I really don't have any ideas on that.

Thanks for your patience and feedback!
