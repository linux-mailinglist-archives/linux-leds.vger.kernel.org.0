Before reading this, I'd have guessed that they switch the internal 
register
depending on the GPIO direction; I mean there is only one register 
address
for both the input and the output register. Hm.

Did you try playing around with raw register accesses and see if the 
value
of the GPIO data register is changing when you switch GPIOs to 
input/output.

Eg. you could try https://github.com/kontron/miitool to access the 
registers
from userspace (your ethernet controller has to have support for the 
ioctl's
though, see commit a613bafec516 ("enetc: add ioctl() support for 
PHY-related
ops") for an example).
