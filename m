The first time I submit a whole module, so please let me know if it made any 
mistakes e.g. I'm unsure if I need add myself explicitly as a maintainer, if 
MODULE_AUTHOR has to be a human, or if i have to split this up into smaller junks.

Also please let me know if i somehow misinterpreted the current API and the 
shortcomings can actually be avoided.

I have not yet looked deeply into triggers, but one idea i had is to only have 
one kbd_backlight by default that just makes the whole keyboard the same color 
and brightness. In addition to that a trigger per_key_control, that, when set, 
adds 125*3 subleds to write the whole keyboard in rainbow colors with a single 
echo to multi_intensity.

The keyboard also supports hardware color effects like color cycle, which 
continuously and smoothly cycles through up to 7 colors. Could this also be 
implemented with a trigger? That trigger would need to add a new entry nr_colors 
and also respectively additional subleds or additional multi_intensity_* entries.

An additional though I had was that it would be nice if the driver could somehow 
communicate the physical location of the key to the userspace for UIs to 
automatically generate a keyboard view to graphically set individual colors.

Kind regards,

Werner Sembach
