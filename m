NP. I prefer fixing issues at the source over awkward workarounds. :)

Two functions duplicated, eight function calls duplicated.

Hm, wasn't aware of those helpers, so I opted not to loop over the bits
for reversing myself, as Thomas Gleixner disliked bit loops in irqchip.
Performance appeared to be a concern here, too.

Eight functions duplicated then. I don't like that - at least we should
pack that into an inline helper or macro, to not copy&paste even more
lines around. Who knows, maybe we'll get 64-bit support at one point?

Do you think it would be acceptable to instead encapsulate this inside
the _be inline helpers? That would lead the name ad absurdum, of course,
but we would then need to do it only twice, not eight times.

However, either way would seem to make the LSB code path slower than MSB
due to the prepended reversal.

Delays are already stubbed out, with open TODOs for further inlining
functions that are being dispatched today.

So from that angle I don't see a better way than either duplicating the
functions or using some macro magic to #include the header twice. If we
wanted to go down that path, we could probably de-duplicate the existing
two functions, too, but I was trying to err on the cautious side, since
I don't have setups to test all four code paths myself (and a ton of
more relevant but less fun patches to flush out ;)).

Regards,
Andreas
