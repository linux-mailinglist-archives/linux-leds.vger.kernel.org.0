I had some thoughts on how the current userspace api could be expanded to better 
reflect the capabilities of RGB keyboards. What would be required for such an 
expansion to be considered?

I'm in contact with the KDE folks. Plasma already has a keyboard brightness 
slider, that soon 
https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/upower/upower/-/merge_requests/203 will work with 
multiple kbd_backlight. However the slowness of 126 sysfs entries makes it a 
little bit janky still.

They are also thinking about expanding desktop accent colors to the keyboard 
backlight when it supports RGB.

I have not reached out to the OpenRGB project yet, but is it alive and well and 
under constant development: https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB. Afaik it 
is currently a userspace only driver interacting directly with hidraw mostly and 
has not yet implemented the sysfs leds interface.

Just listing this to show that there is definitely interest in this.

I'm not sure if I can follow you here. Where would this be implemented? Also I 
asume displays asume equal distance between pixels and that columns are straight 
lines perpendicular to rows, which the key backlights have and are not.

Kind regards,

Werner
