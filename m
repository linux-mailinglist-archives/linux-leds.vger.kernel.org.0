Well, I prefer not to touch the driver itself, so I already resorted to
picking the patch over the latest RC, which is v6.9-rc2 as of now, and
got onto compiling `linux-mainline` AUR package with it. It will be
kind of a hassle considering how I have to write systemd-boot entries
after the installation to get the kernel to appear (one for normal
initramfs and the other for fallback one) and sign the kernel image
using `sbctl` so I don't fail secure boot, but I'm willing to go
through it just for the sake of seeing this driver in action without
bugs related to the "backport" modifications I would do to it.

Oh so the LED zones are in different sysfs directories, that's pretty
good. I might code a simple Bash script to make things easier later
down the road.

Yeah I think I read that somewhere in the initial message. Can't I
change the brightness of the LEDs using Fn+Space anyway if I can't find
the sysfs entries for that? At least it works just fine on the latest
stable release - v6.8.4.

That's pretty nice to hear! If you need someone to test it out on a
12th gen G770, I'm more than willing to do so!

Oh so that's a yes in my case as my laptop has a 12th gen processor.
Glad to know.

Now that's exciting to hear. I haven't seen a laptop that has its power
profiles integrated into the system with a driver in terms of Linux...
At least on the Monster and ASUS laptops I've tried Ubuntu on IIRC.

Also I apologize for the previous (empty) email. I forgot to put one
newline after the "Subject" line, which caused git-send-email to not
pick up the email content.
