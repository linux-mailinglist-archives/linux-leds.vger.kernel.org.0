I guess you could (and we do) have 'cpld' and 'fpga' as devices where 
the OS can reprogram them and such. But if the implementation is fixed 
with no implementation specific controls, I don't think naming how it's 
implemented adds too much. If there's nothing else to identify the 
device though, having 'cpld' in there does have some value I guess.

Same could be argued for soc too perhaps, but that's in the list largely 
to avoid a bunch of s/soc/bus/ on dts files.

Everything is just names invented by DT.

simple-bus means 'a bus containing MMIO devices without any bus 
configuration'. You want to add a clock to it?, then no longer a 
simple-bus. Based on that definition, the kernel can enumerate child 
devices without platform specific help. 

Just use 'cpld-bus' and lets move on with our lives.
