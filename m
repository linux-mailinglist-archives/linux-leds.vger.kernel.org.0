Yes it is. The fix is easy and since we're making major driver changes now...
I needed the fix to properly test the changes we're making, so I thought we
might as well include it.

Ack. I have hardware which uses the ht16k33 in dot matrix mode and I tested
both the backlight and led setup. I ran into this with the fbdev + led setup.

I noticed ht16k33_bl_update_status() is called in ht16k33_fbdev_probe()
before the fbdev device is registered. Which is fine right now, but in theory
the fbdev blank state can influence the backlight setting (nitpick since
the fbdev device is unblanked by default).

The point: Maybe ht16k33_brightness_set() (or ht16k33_bl_update_status() for
backlight device) should be called in one central place (i.e at the end of 
the
main probe function).
