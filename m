Presentations bit rot, so I'd rather not. I'd hope that
writing-schema.rst and example-schema.yaml capture what's in the
presentation. What do you think is missing?

No, nothing is changing for .dts files (other than fixing errors the
schemas find). The free form, human readable only prose called binding
documentation is changing to YAML formatted, json-schema vocabulary
binding schema which can be used to validate dts files.

ICYMI, all the kernel docs are in a markup language now...

Free form descriptions are easier to use because you can put in dts
whatever you want. Nothing is going to check. There's been no shortage
of errors and inconsistencies that we've already found.

You can have as much description and comments as you like (though I'm
trying to cut down on the copy-n-paste genericish 'clock for the
module' type comments).

There is some notion to convert the DT spec to schema and then
generate the spec from the schema. Take properties, their type, and
descriptions and put that back into tables for example. Would love to
have someone work on that. :)

Everyone is welcome to their opinion.
