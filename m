You submit a proposal.

Yep, there's definitely interest.

Yes, I know displays are a bit different from RGB LEDs. Gamma is
another issue. Yes, it is quite weird display. But 6x22 display may be
better approximation of keyboard than ... 126 unrelated files.

Or you could do 6x66 sparse display, I guess, to express the
shifts. But I believe 6x22 would be better.

It would go to drivers/auxdisplay, most probably.

I checked
https://www.tuxedocomputers.com/en/Linux-Hardware/Zubehoer-USB-Co./USB-Zube=
hoer.tuxedo
, but you don't seem to have stand-alone keyboard with such RGB capability.=
=2E.?
