I've responded to patch 5/6 with what should've been said here [1].
Sorry for the confusion.

In any case please consider adding a new binding file instead of
modifying the kb3930 binding doc. It would also remove a dependency on
my patch set which should have slipped out of maintainers' radar.

Take care
