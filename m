Ok, so lets wait for the robot. After that I will try to fix found
issues and send a new patch version.

Yes!

Ok, so stick with cpld.

This was the first thing which I did when I read email. No usable
result. So the next thing was that I started git grep on the linux tree.
Again no result. So at the end I come to the conclusion that you forgot
to copy+paste whole quote or something like that.

Now I started searching a bit more and found it in following documentation:
https://devicetree-specification.readthedocs.io/en/latest/chapter2-devicetree-basics.html#generic-names-recommendation

Original link to the quote would be useful (but now I have it).
