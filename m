Why should I proxy operations that will never be used (pin mux, pin
conf) ? I mean there will never be a driver that will configure FPGA pins.

I thought that the idea was a virtual pinctrl which drive the SoC
pinctrl and the FPGA pinctrl. But what you mean is the FPGA pinctrl acts
as a proxy.

Isn't that a bit over-engineered for my use case ?

For the pinconf / pinmux, the FPGA is just a voltage translator. It is
transparent. The only relevant thing for the FPGA is the direction to
set for the switch of each pin. And the drivers knows which directions
to apply during the probe. This direction will only change in GPIO mode,
but in GPIO mode we know which direction to set.

For the GPIO part, the FPGA provides GPIOs. And in this case it is a
consumer of SoC GPIOs, it is already a kind of aggregator.
