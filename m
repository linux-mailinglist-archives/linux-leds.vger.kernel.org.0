The evaluation starts again with the next iteration of the work.
And if no data was transferred but CTS was set, the LED is enabled again
but does not flash.

That is correct

In the next patch round, I will save the state of the LED and evaluate 
whether
I need to invert the LED if the state of the LED has been set to blink.
