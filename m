Why is mode "unsigned long" when the tty layer treats it as an int?  And
really, this should be set to an explit size, u32 perhaps?  Or am I
confused as to exactly what this is?

Oh wait, is "mode" this?  If so, why not define it as an enum?  Or if
not, I'm totally confused as to what is going on here, sorry.

sysfs_emit() for all new sysfs attributes please.

I think your test of "state" here is wrong, if you write in "40000" you
are treating it as "1", which I don't think you want, right?
