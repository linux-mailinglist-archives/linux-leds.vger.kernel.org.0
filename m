By referring to the "synchronization problem," I am highlighting the
following issue:

The LED controller incorporates PAGE registers for accessing multiple
registers, which can be explained with the analogy of a "window." When
the driver needs to update the brightness value or perform any other
action, it must select the appropriate PAGE window to access the
register offset. It is challenging to believe that the driver,
responsible for adjusting brightness values, can be synchronized with
raw userspace I2C transactions in any manner. However, synchronization
is necessary because the hardware pattern employs the same PAGE
registers used for brightness and other parameter setups.

In the kernel driver, this issue is addressed through the simple mutex
usage.

The PAGE window registers, which I described a few lines earlier, are
relevant. Regarding interrupts, the AW200XX LED controller incorporates
a hardware pattern event based on a straightforward GPIO-connected
interrupt line. It's advisable to asynchronously wait for the hardware
pattern ending event using methods like poll() and to notify userspace
using sysfs_notify().

Currently, we have two methods for playing LED animations:
1) Direct sysfs access to the appropriate brightness node.
2) LED-triggered pattern with hrtimer.

The first method always runs a separate kworker on each access,
resulting in slow performance and complete CPU involvement.  The second
method is straightforward in terms of hardware pattern mechanism
synchronization, but it lacks specific support for the appropriate
hardware (as mentioned earlier). In this option, the CPU is not entirely
engaged because we can free the CPU from the waiting task until the LED
pattern is executed.
