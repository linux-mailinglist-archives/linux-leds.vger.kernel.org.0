AFAICS it is possible to connect LED of arbitrary color to the iouts
of this device. If this is the case then it is justified to have DT
node only to allow for LED name customization.

This is beyond my scope of responsibility. It is MFD subsystem thing to
choose the way of LED class driver instantiation. When it comes to
LED subsystem - it expects single compatible pertaining to a physical
device.

Nonetheless, so far we used to have separate compatibles for drivers of
MFD devices' LED cells. If we are going to change that I'd like to see
explicit DT maintainer's statement confirming that.

And one benefit of having separate nodes per MFD cells is that we can
easily discern the support for which cells is to be turned on.

This way you would probably need to probe LED class driver twice,
instead of letting it behave in a standard way and parse child LED
nodes.

Why leds-dummy ?

The convention is to have led-controller@unit-address as the parent LED
controller node.

This is ePAPR requirement that DT node name should describe the
general class of device.

Common LED bindings say this is the proper way to go. However you
would need compatible to probe LED class driver in DT based way.
If you plan to do it otherwise then it makes no sense to have
DT nodes for LEDs.

Right.

I will not insist - it's up to you. Unless Dan who raised the

OK, so then it's reasonable to use those names in the driver.
I would only add a comment next to the definitions, highlighting
that their names don't imply the scope of supported colors as this is
entirely irrelevant.

AFAIU the LEDs, when in SW mode, can be controlled independently, right?
Because if not then there is no point in having separate LED class
devices.

But if I get it right, then allowing for registering only one LED class
device is entirely justifiable - think of a situation when the iout
remains not connected on the board.

The trigger can be always deactivated from sysfs as well as set up
again.

So the LED trigger interface would help to signalize in which state
the LED is. If the trigger is set then it means the LED is under hw
control.
