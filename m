Some kind of reference, no need to have a special tag in the cover letter.

No. no, no. This is much worse than the glitches. You never know what
the hardware is connected there and it's potential breakage (on hw
level) possible.

Lemme read the datasheet and see if I find any clue for the hw behaviour.
