Yes you are right. In function mode the FPGA selects the I2C pin. When
the FPGA GPIO is requested, the FPGA changes the mux to select a SoC
GPIO pin (a pure GPIO pin).

The FPGA cannot configure pin parameter. It can only configures the
forward direction.
For example, for UART_TX pin the FPGA will set direction as "output" and
for UART_RX pin the FPGA will set direction as "input".
It can also enable/disable the forward of the SoC pin. If the forward of
a pin is disabled, the FPGA pin is in HIGH-Z.

Yes you're right. I mean the mux can only select one function or GPIO mode.
I don't know why there is a mux to select a GPIO only pin, I'm pretty
sure the I2C pins can be set in GPIO mode.
It's probably for an hardware reason that a mux was added for only few pins.
