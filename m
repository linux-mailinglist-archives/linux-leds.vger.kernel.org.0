Yes, unfortunately. Before this path the led should be in
 /sys/devices/.../i2c-client/leds/led
or somthing like that, and after
 /sys/devices/..c/i2c-client/mfd/leds/led

But it should have been this way from beginning, I think. The other
driver, regulator, registers its device under the mfd device.

The question is whether this will break something for someone. I don't
think so, but...
