Marek -

Thanks for taking the time to review this.

I can do this.

I agree with you (and Greg) that this would be preferable, and if
someone were to implement such an API I would happily use it.

However, having looked at fs/block_dev.c and fs/inode.c, I can say with
confidence that I don't have the knowledge of how the inode cache works
that would be needed to implement such an API properly .  More
importantly, I have the definite impression that the block subsystem
maintainers would not be receptive to the idea.

A few explanatory responses below.  Any points that aren't mentioned

I think that it's different, rather than wrong, but I believe that I
can change the interval to a per-LED setting, rather than global.

I have feeling that per-LED work items are likely to cause contention
for the mutex, since they will probably all have the same (default)
interval and they will usually be set up at about the same time (i.e.
at system boot).  Instead, I would propose to have a single work item
that is simply scheduled for the next time work is "needed" and then
checks all LEDs that are due at that time.

I also don't see that this would eliminate the many-to-many mapping.  It
seems like a useful feature.  For example, one could have a bunch of
device-specific read activity LEDs and a shared write (or discard) LED.

Each trig_bdev and trig_led needs a unique index so that it can be added
to one or more xarrays.  The increment-only pattern (capped at
ULONG_MAX - 1) is an easy way to generate unique indices.

And yes, this does mean that you can only associate an LED or a block
device with the trigger about 4 billion times on a 32-bit platform.  I
really can't think of a scenario in which that limitation would be an
issue.

Right ... but how?
