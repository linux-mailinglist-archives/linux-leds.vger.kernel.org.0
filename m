Yes that would be nicer name. thanks

I would say this is correct. At first I check if the tx path should be 
evaluated
and if this is correct I check if there was a tx transmission during the 
last run.

I would say this is correct. At first I check if the rx path should be 
evaluated
and if this is correct I check if there was a rx transmission during the

In my setup my brightness in the sysfs path of the LED ist set to '0'.
Even though the tty trigger was configured correctly the LED was not
turned on. If I set max_brightness in this path the LED works correctly.
I would check this a gain if this is still needed.

Thanks for the hint. I will change this.

Sorry I do not understand your question.

No matter whether the LED is on or off beforehand. I understand that the
LED is always on for the first half of the period and off for the rest 
of
the period. I think that is correct and I don't need to make a 
distinction
via invert here. I hope I have understood your comment correctly here.

> How do interval and the frequency of ledtrig_tty_work() relate?

The work is twice as long as of the interval. So the variable
LEDTRIG_TTY_INTERVAL = 50 and the work is scheduled LEDTRIG_TTY_INTERVAL 
* 2.
But that was also before my change.

Thank you for your feedback. I must say, however, that I am currently in
the process of preparing v6, which will implement the comments and
change requests from 'greg k-h' [1]. The big change here in v6 is, that 
I have
switched to completion and split the change in more reviewable commits.
I will see if your comments can also be incorporated into the new 
approach.
