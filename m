I can change that, I just thought it makes sense to prefix the line 
state
to emphasize the meaning compared to rx and tx.

But then that's tricky! I do not know when the 6.8 is released. February 
2024?

As described by me a few lines below and wanted by you, I will change 
this to
boolean flags for rx,tx,cts,dsr,car and rng.

Before my change, the LED has only flashed if there was a transmission.
This is now the TTY_LED_BLINK state. I could rename this to
TTY_LED_FLASH if that is more familiar.

I saw it in other source files, so I added it. I thought this was
common in the kernel. If this is not the case I will remove this in
the next round.

If I use the DEFINE_TTY_TRIGGER then this cannot happen.
This is an artifact from when I didn't used the DEFINE_TTY_TRIGGER 
macro.
I will remove it in the next round.

Yes, but the trigger rx/tx was already support before my change.
It could not be configured via the sysfs.

In my setup I do not want to show if data is being transferred.
I want to display the line stats.
Therefore I made it configurable to turn it off.

I had never thought of it that way. I will have a look at that.
Thanks for this.

This is what I have adopted from the code before my change.
But it will change this in dev_warn.

I'll have to take a closer look, I don't know that one.
This is what I have adopted from the code before my change.
Shouldn't that be done in a different patch set?

It could not be controlled! The LED flashed when data where transferred.
This was the only function that the trigger supported.

Thanks for your review!
