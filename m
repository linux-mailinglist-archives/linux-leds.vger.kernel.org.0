Glad someone else finds it useful. :)

You don't mention the model: Does it have a mainline .dts we can extend?
If not, I'd ask you to get that merged into -next, then I can happily
pick up patches adding the LED controller for your TV box into this
series as it evolves. (I'm expecting at least two more RFC iterations.)

Similarly, I'm planning to drop Xnano X5 in v2, if it doesn't require a
respin, so that no Realtek-specific parts other than .dts node additions
remain here.

Thanks, their HT1628 indeed looks compatible.

Sunmoon Microelectronics SM1628 also looks compatible.

Hmm, HT16515 looks similar and has more lines, RAM and mode bits than I
prepared here.
https://www.holtek.com/productdetail/-/vg/ht16515

So I'd need to make more numbers model-dependent and allocate the
Display RAM buffer dynamically.

Whereas HT16D35A seems incompatible command-wise, and HT16528 appears to
be out of scope, for dot displays and with fancy embedded character map.

No Holtek email alias that I can quickly spot.

But given that I'm proposing vendor-specific compatibles just in case,
the main decisions will be the Kconfig symbol and module name. The
driver code itself we could always refactor after merging, and renaming
the schema file (as opposed to compatible) should also be possible.

That reminded me that I forgot to push - done in the meantime. :)

Well, that sounds exactly like my bindings example and X9S. You'll find
the colon configured as LED, separate from the four digits, which don't
need to be contiguous due to separate reg entries per digit.

While it may be possible to put more cleverness into text_store() to set
the colon as part of five-char "88:88" text, we'd likely want to blink
it every half second, which we should better do without updating the
full display text from "88:88" to "88 88". "8888" updated every minute
sounds less problematic.

Ugly with the colon LED is that the redone LED bindings don't yet have a
function defined for this, so I'm currently misusing whatever was there.
I should prepare a bindings addition, if we want to use an LED node.

Regards,
Andreas
