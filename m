Hello Pavel and Arnd,

This one has slipped through the cracks. Andrew asked for a follow up
and Linus sent a review, but we haven't heard from Pavel at all.

We've merged device tree changes through the soc tree in v5.16 that
depend on this patch. Ideally I would like to see it applied to fix
those device trees, instead of sending reverts for the device trees.

Additionally, I'm now reviewing changes for v5.17 and want to decide
which direction we should take.

Pavel, are you happy with the change?

If so, would you consider merging it as a fix for v5.16?

Cheers,

Joel
