Because it's usually how maintainers work (at least Lee and Greg KH come
to my mind), when new cycle starts, the (potentially rebased) new versions
are expected.

But with powerfulness of `b4` tool it might be that they changed their ways
of maintaining. You need to ask the LED maintainer(s) on how to proceed.
