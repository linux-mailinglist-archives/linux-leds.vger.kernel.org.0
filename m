Ah, OK.  I didn't even notice that patch when I scanned the series.
I'll look out for this next time around but that sounds like it's
generally going in the right direction, especially if it's integrated
with the suspend mode regulator bindings that Chunyan did.

Yes, I think this needs clarification as I completely failed to pick up
on this and did indeed read this as referring to the modes.  "Voltages
that can be set in RUN mode" or something?  I take it these voltages are
fixed and the OS can't change them?
