Also works but you have to provide this information in the cover letter.

GPIO tools for the shell are context-less. Can you reproduce this with
the legacy sysfs interface?

Do you possess a schematic of either of the devices and a link to the
RTL datasheet (Btw, if it's publicly available, or you have a link
that will ask for necessary sign-in it would be nice to include the
link to it as a Datasheet: tag)?
