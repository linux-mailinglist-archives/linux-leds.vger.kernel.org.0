Subject: [RFC PATCH 0/1] leds: backlight: Register with class backlight

When using current LCD drivers as ledtrig backlight they're
not registered with the backlight device class. This has
two problems: they're usually not found by userspace since
these tools usually look in /sys/class/backlight and they
can't be used as backlight phandles in device tree for
e.g. LCD panels.

This is an RFC if this is worthwhile at all? A current problem
is that changing the LED brightness does currently not notify
the class backlight so they can get out of sync but i could
look into that if the approach makes sense.
