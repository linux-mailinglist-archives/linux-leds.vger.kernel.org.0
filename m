The cases for not having child nodes are when you have child nodes
with nothing more than a compatible and possibly provider properties
(e.g. #gpio-cells for gpio providers). If you have other resource
dependencies (e.g. clocks) or data to define (e.g. voltages for
regulators), then child nodes absolutely make sense. Once we have
child nodes, then generally it is easier for every function to be a
child node and not mix the two. I'm sure I have told people
incorrectly to not do child nodes because they define incomplete
bindings.

I would group the led nodes under an led-controller node (with a
compatible). The simple reason is each level only has one
number/address space and you can't mix different ones. You're not
numbering the leds here, but could you (with numbers that correspond
to something in the h/w, not just 0..N)? The other reason is modern
LED bindings define a controller node for the controller and led nodes
for the actual led on the board. While the MFD node could be the
controller node, that gets into mixing.
