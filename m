The rule is the same from years and no one was changing it. All driver
submitters, all DTS developers follow this. You are literally the one of
very few which is surprised by that generic rule and call it "a change".
The patches should be accepted by maintainers in such order (so without
bindings acceptance, the driver and DTS should not go), but not the
sending order.

It's the same with sysfs ABI. Exactly the same.

Best regards,
Krzysztof
