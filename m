The BUG_ON was a no-op since it was introduced. It's purpose was to
prevent people from using LED_COLOR_ID_MULTI since it was thought that
non-RGB LEDs are not yet completely agreed on, or something.

But since the BUG_ON was a no-op, someone started using
LED_COLOR_ID_MULTI without noticing that they should not. There are now
even some in-tree device-tree files using LED_COLOR_ID_MULTI.

My patch that fixes the BUG_ON uncovered this and caused a regression
for some people.

I think we have to drop the BUG_ON altoghether now.

I've sent a patch to linux-leds doing just that.

Sorry for the incovenience.

Marek
