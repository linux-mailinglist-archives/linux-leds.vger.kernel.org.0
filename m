My Dear Beloved.

Greetings in the name of our Lord, it is in my search for a reliable
and God fearing person and having gotten your contact through prayers
and  pains taking efforts via searching I made on the internet on my
bed side. Presently, I'm in a hospital here in Beijing, China where I
have been undergoing therapy treatment for Oesophagi Cancer.

Though its a sad and long story but I will cut it short for your quick
 and easy understanding. I am Mariam D. Deng (Mrs), widow to Mr.
Dominic Dim Deng, former Defense Minister of the Southern Sudanese
government. My husband was murdered with other 19 Military officers in
a plane  crash in the Southern Sudanese town Rumbek by those who are
envious of his position in the same office leaving me with our only
daughter Lisa.

Please visit this link for verification:
http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/7380412.stm

Before his death he deposited the sum of $5,000,000.00 (Five Million
Usd) in a Vault with a security House in the UNITED KINGDOM.
Presently,this money is still there we were both strong believers in
GOD and because of our new found faith we both made a covenant with
God Almighty to use his wealth for the orphanages and the less
privileged in the society. Recently, my Doctor told me that I would
not last for the next seven (7) months due to the cancer problem.
Though what disturbs me most is my only child and her future welfare.

Having known my condition I decided to donate this fund to an
individual or better still a God fearing kind person who will utilize
this money the way I instruct here. but what is required from you is
your honesty, trust and sincerity,Please reply me back if you are
interested to do the work of God this is my
email:(md2701240@gmail.com)so that i will give you some details and
all further information's concerning the fund.

May God Almighty bless you.

Mrs.Mariam Dim Deng
