Alright, I don't mind to separate the bindings. Although, before doing
that, I'd want to get opinion from the device-tree experts, i.e. from
Rob Herring :)

Rob, will it be fine to have separate bindings for each firmware version
of the ENE controller given that firmware is individual for every device
and given that FW has no compatibility with other devices?
