(I couldn't help but be confused for a minute by this being a reply to
the original v1 patchset from March 2017 :) )

Does that mean there's still some time to review / pick up [1]
(LPG enablement for PM660L)?  And even more so for [2] (fixing the use
of a software-pattern variable in the hardware-pattern code) which
complements Bjorn's series but hasn't been looked at ever since last
year.

I wouldn't mind picking up this issue (discussed in the v14 series at
[3]) and unblock you sending the tree to Linus without reverting, if
Bjorn doesn't have the bandwidth for it currently.  But I will need
confirmation that patches sent in my name actually get looked at...
Thanks!
