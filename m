Yes maybe, there still does not feel like this deserves a shared header,
but as long as the generated code is the same, why not.

readl() includes barriers and read_relaxed() does not, hence the
difference in the name. There is no need to pay the price of a barrier
when a) the bus architecture guarantees non re-ordering and posting and
that statement is true on all the SoCs where these peripherals are used,
and b) you have worked on fine tuning your drivers to get the most
performance out of them.

The Broadcom MIPS CPUs (we have/had an architectural license) can be
strapped for BE or LE, and when that happens the bridge that connects to
the registers follows the CPU's endian, which is why __raw_{read,write}l
is appropriate for these specific peripherals.

Given these peripherals can only be used on CPUs/SoCs made by Broadcom,
any argument about portability to other SoCs is moot.
