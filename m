It's pretty cool to see this! My Rockchip box has an AiP1618-driven 
display that I've also spent a bit of time hacking around with - I did 
get some way into writing an LED driver, but ultimately gave up and 
wrote a simple thing to bit-bang the GPIO chardev from userspace (and 
since there are enough clocks in my house, I now have a cpufreq display!)

In case it helps, in my research I found that ARTSCHIP are another 
vendor of these things with accessible datasheets[1], and as far as I 
could tell the command set appears to derive from (or is at least common 
to) some old Holtek VFD controllers.

If I can figure out the DT parts (which was one of the areas that 
stalled my attempt) I'll try to have a play with this series over the 
holidays. One thought to ponder is that I have an "88:88" display where 
the entire middle grid is reserved for the colon (which is wired to just 
one segment) - I'm not sure how that could be sanely described :/

Robin.
