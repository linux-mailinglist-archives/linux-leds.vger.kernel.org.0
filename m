Misunderstanding. I meant that I don't consider the eventual
inconsistency a problem, i.e. I agree with your code.

But now you do an unnecessary check. Unless the writeb() is slower than
that check. Since this isn't i2c, I am wondering how fast that writeb()
is... But this is just me wondering, we can keep it the way you wrote
it...

What do you mean all other drivers? AFAIK only one driver does this
global brightness thing, and that is Omnia. The global brightness is
something different from LED cdev brightness property, the same names
are just coincidental (in fact it caused confusion when Pavel was
first reviewing Turris Omnia driver). Maybe it should have been called
global_intensity, to avoid the confusion...

One file that represents the index of the selected global intensity (as
is stored internally in the CPLD) and another file that represents the
configured intensities between which the button switches makes sense,
IMO.

Again, the name "brightness" does not imply that it is the same thing
as "brightness" of a LED cdev. And since it even doesn't live in
/sys/class/<led>/ directory, we are proposing new API and can use
whatever makes sense.

I am not saying that the way you did it doesn't make sense. I am just
wondering if it wouldn't make more sense to be able to read the index
of what the user selected by button pressing.
