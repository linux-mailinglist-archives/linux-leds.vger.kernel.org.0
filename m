Ok. So I should change maxItems to 1 in this case?

And how you want to describe those items?

Ou... this is something which I was not able to run, it just does not
work, throws lot of python dependency hell errors and it spend more than
hour with it. So sorry, I really cannot run it. Maybe it would be a wise
to provide web service for these checks for those who cannot run them
locally?

Ok. So does it mean that I should just add
"unevaluatedProperties: false"?

If you never heard about it, I would suggest to read something about
Programmable logic devices. It is interesting category of hardware with
which you can play. CPLD and FPGA are very often used in lot of products
and FPGA is very easy for playing and programming custom logic.

For example on wikipedia is list of different technologies of
programmable logic devices:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programmable_logic_device

So if you want more generic name, just name it "pld"? But as it is CPLD
device I would suggest to name it really as "cpld". It does not matter
from which manufactor you have CPLD, just like it does not matter from
which manufactor you have NAND.

From bus point of view, cpld is like nand or nor nodes in DTS. All of
them refers to specific memory map of chip selects on the local bus.

Hm... You forgot to send what are those "choices:"?
