You might want to take a look at commit 7794f486ed0b ("usbfs: Add
ioctls for runtime power management") in the usb-next branch of Greg
KH's usb.git tree.  It adds a mechanism for user programs to wait until
a device has done a runtime resume, without races.

But it is not general purpose (it applies only to USB devices), it
doesn't use poll(), and it doesn't check for other kinds of runtime PM
status changes.
