The regulator driver has a bunch fo set_suspend_ operations.

set_suspend_voltage.

That doesn't make sense at all, the modes affect the quality of
regulation not the voltage that is set.

We don't really have anything that'd only work for group configuration
except for the suspend modes.

The cpufreq code is all there in kernel - drivers/cpufreq.  I can't
remember if Android still has a custom governor in their trees but it
doesn't really make much difference in terms of how it interacts with
the regulator drivers.

It'd be much better if you could avoid putting the voltages in the
binding if they're not strictly required.
