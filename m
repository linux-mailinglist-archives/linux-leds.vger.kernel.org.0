Hi Andy, Linus,

I did some tests/experiments to implement a proxy pinctrl as requested
by Andy.
I have made progress, but now I have questions and blocking points.

First thing, to identify the SoC pins used by the FPGA, I have to
request the corresponding GPIOs (defined in the ACPI tables). Using the
GPIO descriptor I'm able to find the corresponding pinctrl device and
the pin number (thanks to pinctrl_get_device_gpio_range()).

I store all the pinctrl device an pin number couples in a radix tree.

struct pin_fwd {
	struct pinctrl_dev *pctldev;
	int pin;
};

struct pinctrl_fwd {
	struct device *dev;
	struct radix_tree_root pin_fwd_tree;
	unsigned int num_pins;
};

So for a FPGA pin, I can easily get find the corresponding SoC pin.
I request the SoC pins (thanks to pin_request()) during the probe to
lock access.
I'm able to forward some pinctrl or pinconf ops like dbg_show(),
config_get() ...

But I don't really know how to deal with pinmux ops, groups and functions.
I cannot just forward a set_mux() call.
Should I have a mapping between SoC pinctrl and FPGA pinctrl for all
groups and functions ?
Other issue with GPIO mode, in gpio_request_enable() I'm able to request
the SoC pin using pin_request() and a gpio_range. But in this case
gpiolib does not know the GPIO is requested.
And how to deal with set() and get() ?

Other problem I noticed, but maybe only due to the fact I implemented
everything in my driver, I had to export symbols of many static
functions like pin_request(), pinctrl_get_device_gpio_range(),
pinconf_dump_pin() ...

An other problem is that as I requested GPIO to identify all SoC pins
connected to the FPGA, I have to set it back to function mode, and I'm
not sure it is possible to do it for all pins (some pins are not
registered in a group, maybe they are not writable ?).

So I'm not really convinced by all this complexity for only one driver.

In the same time I had an other idea and I would like your advises.

The FPGA pinctrl is a consumer of SoC pins, so I can add some
pinctrl_map to request the SoC pins and mark them as used by the FPGA:

PIN_MAP_MUX_GROUP("upboard-pinctrl", "soc_pins", "INT3452:00",
		"pwm0_grp", "pwm0"),
PIN_MAP_MUX_GROUP("upboard-pinctrl", "soc_pins", "INT3452:00",
		"uart1_grp", "uart1"),

And in the probe() I call devm_pinctrl_get_select() to request and
configure SoC pins.

Pros:
- the SoC pins are marked as used by the FPGA.
- less complex solution, no change in the core.

Cons:
- probably one mapping for each board as Intel pinctrl device, groups
and functions may change depending the board. So the right mapping
should be selected based on DMI table.

This solution also implies to make some changes in Intel pinctrl driver
to create missing groups. Or maybe the pins which are not in a group are
not writeable (so no need to request them) ?

For the GPIO part, no changes, the SoC GPIO are requested at runtime
using gpiod (Linus I did not forget you mentioned to use/rework
gpio-aggregator).

Best Regards,

Thomas
