I've actually added that to submitting-patches.txt already and
checkpatch.pl now warns for non-schema bindings. Both are pending for
5.5.

Not really. writing-bindings.txt is about how to design bindings. It's
the DO's and DON'Ts that I give in review comments over and over and
over. Mostly an attempt to ensure I'm saying things that are
documented somewhere. Probably need to come up with better names, but
naming is hard(TM).

Either look at how Kbuild calls dt-doc-validate or just use 'make
dt_binding_check'. (It needs the base path to the schema passed in.)
