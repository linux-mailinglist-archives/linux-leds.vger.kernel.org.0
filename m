It's the Beelink A1, which we have indeed just landed a DT for - I'll 
certainly share whatever patch I come up with. I also have one of the 
H96 Max boxes (which I picked up out of curiosity for the mysterious 
RK3318) with an FD6551, although I've not attacked that one with the 
logic analyser yet to see how similar it is.

Yeah, I'm not sure that it really matters, as I doubt there are many 
Linux-capable devices with a real VFD anyway; it just seemed like an 
interesting datapoint that fell out of scouring the web trying to find 
any evidence for which the "canonical" 1618 might be (and the Holtek 
connection was actually a coincidence from a misidentification of the 
ARTSCHIP part number).

Aha, yes, I should have engaged the brain a bit more on that one :)

Sure - perhaps at that point text_store() could also grow some caching 
and partial update logic to decide if writing individual grids is 
cheaper than clocking out the whole display for a given change, but this 
initial approach does seem good enough to start with. Lumping colons in 
with the other miscellaneous indicators many of these displays have does 
at least have a self-consistent logic in terms of "things that aren't 
7-segment grids".

Thanks,
Robin.
