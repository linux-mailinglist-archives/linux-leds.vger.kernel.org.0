Hans, sorry for disturbing you later too much. Here we have "nice"
hardware which can't be used in a glitch-free mode (somehow it reminds
me lynxpoint, baytrail, cherryview designs). If you have any ideas to
share (no need to dive deep or look at it if you have no time), you're
welcome.

No ideas so far. In x86 we used to have something similar (baytrail,
cherryview, lynxpoint), but it's firmware assisted. I think that this
hardware (realtek) is supposed either
- to be firmware / bootloader assisted, so in a way that platform is
preconfigured when Linux starts and any GPIO request won't be harmful
as long as it doesn't change direction on the pins (which is usually
guaranteed by DT and corresponding drivers to do the correct things)
- be used for glitch-tolerant hardware (LEDs, for example, where
nobody usually will noticed 1ms blink)

That said, I have not been convinced we have to quirk gpio-regmap for
this one. Just describe the issues with hardware in the accompanying
documentation.

But if maintainers or somebody comes with a better / different
approach I am all ears.
