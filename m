I don't think this is ever going to happen unless someone is actually
going to do it. And that won't be me - I just don't have the time
(nor appetite - introducing new pieces of infrastructure seems to take
forever nowadays).

Having said that, if using request_muxed_region() is considered
unacceptable, you'll have to find a different method to control
superio access to the chip.

I have no real opinion on this. The nct6775 driver first registers the
driver, then the device, which causes it to probe. That is how hwmon
drivers (and watchdog drivers, for that matter) have historically done
it, and I never found a reason to change it since it just works. If that
is considered to be wrong nowadays, I will be happy to accept patches
if someone can tell me what exactly is wrong with it and why, and how
it can cause problems.
