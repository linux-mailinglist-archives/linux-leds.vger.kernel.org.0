No. The TLC5925 driver updates the register asynchronously: the cached 
value of the register is updated synchronously and then it is 
transferred over SPI using a workqueue. This way if multiple LED are set 
in a short time, the changes are coalesced into a single SPI transfer. 
This is however probably not a must-have feature.
