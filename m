I think that testing if some bit is set in 32-bit general purpose
processor register is something which really does not play role here.

Note that readb() is always needed to do because it is required to
modify just one bit and this cannot be done without read-modify-write
operations.

Ok. I thought "brightness" == "brightness" too.

Anyway, as Omnia has this API it makes sense to use same API for other
devices, this allows userspace software to be compatible with more
devices.

And this is the issue. If you want to get current brightness, you need
to read two files and then do non-trivial logic to derive current
brightness.

So what about exporting another sysfs file which controls current level (0-7)?
