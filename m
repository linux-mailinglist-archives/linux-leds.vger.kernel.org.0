Ok, I will add the link to the cover letter for the next version. Does it need
to be in a Link-tag, or can just be a reference?

Sadly, I don't. Most of the info we have comes from code archives of switch
vendors (Zyxel, Cisco etc). Boards need to be reverse engineered, and the few
leaked datasheets that can be found on the internet aren't exactly thick in
information.

The RTL8231 datasheet is actually quite useful, but makes no mention of the
output value isse. Since this isn't an official resource, I don't think it would
be appropriate to link it via a Datasheet: tag.
https://github.com/libc0607/Realtek_switch_hacking/blob/files/RTL8231_Datasheet_
1.2.pdf

Looking at the datasheet again, I came up with a... terrible hack to work around
the output value issue.

The chip also has GPIO_INVERT registers that I hadn't used until now, because
the logical inversion is handled in the kernel. However, these inversion
registers only apply to the output values. So, I could implement glitch-free
output behaviour in the following way:
 * After chip reset, and before enabling the output driver (MFD initialisation):
    - Mux all pins as GPIO
    - Change all pins to outputs, so the data registers (0x1c-0x1e) become writable
    - Write value 0 to all pins
    - Change all pins to GPI to change them into high-Z
 * In the pinctrl/gpio driver:
    - Use data registers as input-only
    - Use inversion register to determine output value (can be written any time)

The above gives glitch-free outputs, but the values that are read back (when
configured as output), come from the data registers. They should now be coming
from the inversion (reg_set_base) registers, but the code prefers to use the
data registers (reg_dat_base).


Best,
Sander
