I think your point is that if the _DSM is supported, the platform
itself might be using NPEM internally, and maybe that would conflict
with an OS that uses NPEM directly, which is a good question.

There is no ownership negotiation, e.g., via _OSC, so my assumption is
that the OS owns NPEM by default, and the platform should not touch a
PCI device to operate NPEM after booting the OS.  I guess the platform
must take ownership of the NPEM Capability if the OS uses the _DSM,
although the spec isn't very explicit about this.

One concern here is that if the OS avoids use of NPEM when the _DSM is
present, NPEM will work on the OS we ship today (with NPEM but no _DSM
support), but it will break as soon as a new platform or new firmware
release adds the _DSM, and users will have no way to fix it.
