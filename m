Got around to testing things.

If En_Sync_GPIO is enabled, it's still possible to change the pin direction
without also writing the Sync_GPIO bit. So even with the latching, glitches are
still produced.

As long as Sync_GPIO is not set to latch the new values, it also appears that
reads of the data registers result in the current output value, not the new one.

As a different test, I've added a pull-down, to make the input level low. Now I
see the opposite behaviour as before (with set-value-before-direction):
 * OUT-HIGH > IN (low) > OUT-LOW: results in a high level (i.e. old value)
 * OUT-HIGH > IN (low) > OUT-HIGH: results in a high level (new/old value)
 * OUT-LOW > IN (low) > OUT-HIGH: results in a high level (new value, or toggled
   old value?)
 * OUT-LOW > IN (low) > OUT-LOW: results in a low level (new/old value)

For reference, with a pull-up:
 * OUT-HIGH > IN (high) > OUT-HIGH: high result
 * OUT-HIGH > IN (high) > OUT-LOW: low result
 * OUT-LOW > IN (high) > OUT-HIGH: low result
 * OUT-LOW > IN (high) > OUT-LOW: low result

I've only tested this with the sysfs interface, so I don't know what the result
would be on multiple writes to the data register (during input, but probably not
very relevant). Nor have I tested direction changes if the input has changed
between two output values.

I may have some time tomorrow for more testing, but otherwise it'll have to wait
until the weekend. Any other ideas in the meantime?


Best,
Sander
