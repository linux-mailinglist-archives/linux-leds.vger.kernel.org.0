You don't need to do anything special.

The Fixes: tag is enough to let us know that this is a fix.

If the commit mentioned in Fixes: was accepted as part of the last
merge-window, it'll be sent to the -rcs in good time.  If it fixes a
commit which was introduced in a previous cycle, it'll be submitted
during the next merge-window.

There is no reason why this should be merged via netdev.
