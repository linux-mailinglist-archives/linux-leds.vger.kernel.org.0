OK, then I can just iterate over all child fwnodes.

The chip appears to be intended for use with ethernet switches. The registers
are organised to into a few groups, to provide 2 or 3 status LEDs per switch
port:

 * "LED0" group for 32 ports,
 * "LED1" group for 32 ports,
 * "LED2" group for 24 ports

The number of LEDs that can be used depends on the output mode, so I use a two-
part <#PORT #LED> address, resembling how this is defined by Realtek.

A single linear LED address space would get awkward gaps in bi-color mode (where
only the lower 24 ports can be used), but would still require addresses to be
able to specify which LED is where. For example in case the user want to link
them to a phy trigger for a specific switch port.

Best,
Sander
