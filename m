Hi Andy,

I found a trick to workaround the get_direction() issue in the
gpio-aggregator.

I added a "request on first use" feature on the aggregator.
The GPIO is requested during the request() operation of the fowarder.

static int gpio_fwd_request(struct gpio_chip *chip, unsigned int offset)
{
	struct gpiochip_fwd *fwd = gpiochip_get_data(chip);

	if (!IS_ERR_OR_NULL(fwd->descs[offset]))
		return 0;

	fwd->descs[offset] = devm_gpiod_get_index(fwd->dev, NULL,
						offset, GPIOD_ASIS);

	return PTR_ERR_OR_ZERO(fwd->descs[offset]);
}

The remaining problem is that the get_direction() callback is called
during gpiochip registration. For now if the gpio_desc is not valid (so
the GPIO was not yet requested) I return GPIO_LINE_DIRECTION_OUT by
default. But I'm not very convinced by this hack.
Maybe I could retrieve the gpio_chip and call its get_direction()
callback, but it seems not to be a better idea.

For the pinctrl-aggregator you mentioned, if I understand correctly the
idea to aggregate the SoC pins in a pinctrl aggregator (with a
gpio_chip) which just forwards gpio_request_enable(),
gpio_disable_free(), gpio_set_direction() and also all gpio_chip operations.

But how to deal with the pinctrl of my FPGA ? For one of its fake pin
the dummy pinctrl drives the corresponding SoC pin and FPGA pin ? So for
each pin, the aggregator may have multiple pins to drive ?

Was it your idea Andy ?

Other challenge is to retrieve all the pins to add in the
pinctrl-aggregator. As input I have only GPIO descriptors, but I guess
it should be feasible.

Best Regards,

Thomas
