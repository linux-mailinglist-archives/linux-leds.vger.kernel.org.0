Well that is not true.  Intensity and brightness are two different spaces.

Brightness is for cluster control and intensity is for monochrome LED 
control.

There only relationship is when setting cluster brightness.

I have working code now.  Just need to clean it up and test it.

Should be submitted by EOW.
