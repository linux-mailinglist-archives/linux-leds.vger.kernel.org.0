Hi Andy, Mark,

My apologies for the delay in replying, work has been keeping me a bit busy.

I've made an attempt at implementing a "regmap_aliased()", similar to
"regmap_volatile()". However, this meant I had to make _regmap_read() aware of
wether the read- or write-alias was being read (from cache), touching some parts
of the regmap code I'm not using myself. Furthermore, this "aliased" property
isn't really perpendicular to "volatile", since writes should never be volatile,
and non-volatile reads don't make much sense (to me) on a read-only register.

In addition to entire registers having different meanings on reads or writes,
individual bitfields could also have different properties. Some bits of a
register could be aliased, while other bits are just 'plain' volatile. This is
the case for the last register of the RTL8231, where the low bits are GPIO data
(so aliased), and the highest bit is a self-clearing "latch new data" command
bit (i.e. RW-volatile).

If a regmap_field could overwrite the specifiers of it's parent register, I
think this may provide quite a natural solution to the aliasing problem: just
create two regmap_field defintions. One definition would be 'write-only' (and
cached for RMW), the other 'volatile read-only'. All regmap_fields could still
rely on a single cached register value, I think. I didn't try to implement this
though, so maybe I'm missing some behaviour that would disqualify this solution.
Would you think this could be an acceptable way to move forward here?

This implementation indeed requires the same aliasing support, in addition to
register paging even. I've never touched that subsystem before though, so I
would need some more time if I wanted to try this.

Best,
Sander
