Ahh so this makes more sense. If the data register is really write only
regardless of the direction mode, then RMW doesn't make any sense at 
all.
Please note, that even if regmap caches values, it might be marked as 
dirty
and it will re-read the values from hardware. So I don't know if that 
will
help you.

So a possible quirk could be
  GPIO_REGMAP_WRITE_ONLY_DATA_REG (or something like that)

I'm not sure if regmap can cache the value for us or if we have to do it
ourselves.

Ha I've thought of the same thing, but there might be hardware which
actually mux the data in and data out register. Thus I think we have
to distiguish between:

  (1) write only data registers
  (2) muxed data in/data out according to the direction

for (1) we'd have to cache the value (ourselves (?))
for (2) we'd only need to drop a cached value if we switch directions

mh, I don't see how this will work with a write only register. I seems
that you might accidentially change the values of the other GPIOs in
this registers (that is depending on the input of them, because you
are still doing a RMW).
