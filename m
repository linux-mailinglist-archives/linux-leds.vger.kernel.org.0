So "voltage voltage drop rate"? And '-microvolt' says this is voltage 
too. :)

I don't think that's the right direction. It's not a Rohm battery.

That seems like the right thing to do here. 

The main question for me is whether these should even be Rohm specific? 
That would probably require a 2nd user to answer for sure.

Only if you think something is not complete and/or the patches should 
not be applied.
