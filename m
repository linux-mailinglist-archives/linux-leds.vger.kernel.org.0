Sorry for asking, but why should I split the change.
What is the added value? But if it is necessary, then I will do it.

Before my change, the trigger could not be configured.
The LED always flashed when data was transferred.
Now I can configure for which tty event the LED should flash or be 
on/off.
So that the trigger behaves the same as before (flash on rx/tx 
transmission),
I set the rx/tx bits in the function ledtrig_tty_activate() with the
following code. Nothing changes for the user of the trigger.

/* Enable default rx/tx LED blink */
set_bit(TRIGGER_TTY_TX, &trigger_data->ttytrigger);
set_bit(TRIGGER_TTY_RX, &trigger_data->ttytrigger);
