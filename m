Yes

In that case, no need to describe.

It's one pip command to install and one make command to run... I would
say easy to start using, unless of course you use some unusual distro
without Python 3 (cannot believe nowadays...) or without pip.

Rob's bot will test it for you.

Anyway, in such case please mark your bindings always as RFT, so we will
not waste time on reviewing obvious stuff which is found by automated
tools. I think we both agree that reviewers time should not be used for
trivial stuff already pointed out by compiler/linter/automation.

Yes, on that level of indentation, so:
    $ref: leds-class-multicolor.yaml#
    unevaluatedProperties: false

The are many different acronyms in the language so without context might
be tricky to connect the dots.

That one would be fine.

Then cpld is fine as well.

I didn't, I just assumed you will Google it (or use other web-search
engine of your choice) to get the spec. As this is a quote, Google
results should be very accurate. No need to duplicate entire pages of
publicly available specification.
