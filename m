The triggers phy0tx and hci0-power are missed.

Since you've rewritten it, please consider sorting these property strings
in ascending alphabetical order.

should be ^cpu[0-9]{1,2}$, otherwise, it always requires two digit.

should be '^mmc[0-9]{1,2}$'

Why CPU use "", and mmc use ''ï¼ŒIt's better to keep them consistent.
