Are you referring to the MDIO regmap interface, or the GPIO regmap interface?

For the MDIO regmap interface, I have been able to resolve the Kconfig
dependency issue. So I can reintroduce that, if that's preferred over the
solution in this v1.

With an extra patch, I was able to use the gpio-regmap interface, dropping most
of the GPIO code. The current gpio-regmap implementation makes the assumption
that an output value can be set while a pin is configured as an input. That
assumption is invalid for this chip, so I had to provide an extra flag for
gpio_regmap_config, similar to how this is handled in gpio-mmio.


> 2. Please, switch to fwnode API in LED driver

Since you had the same comment on my previous patch set, I had already tried to
this this into account as much as possible.

There's a few things I couldn't find the fwnode-equivalent for:
 * I use of_node_name_prefix to enforce the naming required by the binding. I
   could just walk over all (available) child nodes, which would be mostly
   equivalent.
 * To get the address of an LED child node, I use of_get_address, since this
   appeared to provide what I want to do: get the address of the node. I know
   next to nothing about ACPI. Does the equivalent exist there? Or am I taking
   the wrong approach?


I have updated patches ready, if you would rather just review a v2.


Best,
Sander
