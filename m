Probably the latter option. You could do the former and make the new 
properties conditional on the "vdr-battery" compatible. That's fine with 
small differences, but gets messy as there are more properties and 
variations.

But is "VDR" a type of battery though? Is there a certain type/chemistry 
of battery we should be describing where VDR is applicable? I don't 
think it scales well if we define battery compatibles for every 
variation of charger algorithm. Honestly I don't mind just adding 1 
property. I care more if we allow undocumented properties than 
allowing documented but invalid for the platform properties. When it 
becomes 10, 20, 30 properties, then I might start to care. If that 
happens, either we are doing a poor job of generically describing 
battery parameters or chargers and batteries are tightly coupled and 
can't be described independently.
