I guess the paragraph needs to be rephrased.  The point is that
if this NPEM driver sets bit A and another bit B is already set,
and the hardware is incapable of lighting up whatever is controlled
by these two bits *simultaneously*, the hardware might clear bit B
when setting bit A.  The driver can cope with that because
npem_set() reads back the register contents with npem_read_reg()
after calling npem_set_active_patterns().

I think the leds subsystem expects the LED to be lit up by the time
the ->brightness_set_blocking() callback returns.  If the driver waited
for command completion *before* setting a bit instead of afterwards,
it could happen that npem_set() (the ->brightness_set_blocking() callback)
returns even though the command hasn't completed yet and the LED thus
isn't lit up yet.

Thanks,

Lukas
