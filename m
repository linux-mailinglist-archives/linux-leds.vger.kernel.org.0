Hi,

I'm the author of the 'other' work. I don't know the full story here, 
but I don't
mind someone else submitting this patch as his.

When I submitted the last patch, there was the proposal to use the 
ledtrig-pattern instead
of sysfs entries. Also AXP209 has inverted CTRL bit.

Please read the the 'other' discussion.

Best regards,
Stefan Mavrodiev
