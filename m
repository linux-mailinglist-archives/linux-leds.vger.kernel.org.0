It sometimes does. The ENE's downstream driver suggests there are parts
that run more-or-less stock firmware that are comatible with each other.
That is why I grabbed the generic kb3930 name.

Note the DT is not the hardware description. It's the description of how
the hardware presents itself, from the software's perspective. As far as
that is concerned, the devices don't seem to have anything in common at
all (other than the bus address). The fact that you need an entirely
different driver implies this.

This would be the case even if the A500 EC was based directly on a KB3930.

A good reason to keep bindings for different yet somewhat similar devices in
a single document is to avoid duplication. Yet here there's very little to
share here. If you've done your bindings correctly, you'd need to
conditionalize the monitored-battery and power-supplies properties for
acer,a500-iconia-ec, complicating the binding too much. It makes more
sense to just add a new document.

Thanks,
Lubo
