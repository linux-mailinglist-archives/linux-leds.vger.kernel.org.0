No, you check if the *RX* path should be evaluated! On the bright side: 
this is
fixed in the new patch set.

Same difference.

I see you've dropped this from the new patch set. Thank you.

This explains why you don't necessarily need to invert the blink.
If E.g. both CTS and TX are configured I would expect to see the led 
turn on
once CTS actives and then blink off when something is transmitted. After 
that
I expect to see the led still on because CTS is still active.

Now only because the work interval is 2*LEDTRIG_TTY_INTERVAL and the 
blink
uses an interval of LEDTRIG_TTY_INTERVAL for both on and off the user 
doesn't
notice any difference except maybe a bit of delay of the blink.

If either the work schedule was larger than 2*LEDTRIG_TTY_INTERVAL or 
the on
interval would differ from the off interval the behaviour would differ
noticably.

This is why I recommend to use an invert variable that is set to true 
when
the previous state was TTY_LED_ENABLE.
