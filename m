Changes in v5:
==============
- Update commit message as request by greg k-h, to make the commit message
  more generic and not focusing on my use case [1]. Thanks for that.
- Removing PATCH v4 1/3 from previous set. This has been already applied to
  tty-testing [2] by greg k-h.
- As requested by greq k-h. I have also made the following changes to
  PATCH v4 3/3 [3].
  * Add a comment to the enum that this is already used for bit evaluation and
    sysfs read and write.
  * Renaming the variable 'unsigned long mode' to 'unsigned long ttytrigger'
    in the ledtrig_tty_data structure to make it clearer that the selected
    triggers are stored there.
  * Using sysfs_emit() function to dump the requestd ttytrigger to userland.
  * Also using the kstrtobool() function to write the selected ttytrigger
    via the sysfs. This values are booleans.
- I also removed the function ledtrig_tty_evaluate() from my last patchset.
  PATCH v4 3/3 [3]. The new API tty_get_tiocm() function is only called once
  now and checked for each ttytrigger bit. Previously this function was
  called for each bit, which is not necessary.

Changes in v4:
==============
v4: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-leds/20231019112809.881730-1-fe@dev.tdt.de/
- Merging patch 3/4 into patch number 4/4 from previous series, because
  it fixes a problem that does not exist upstream. This was a note from
  the build robot regarding my change that I added with previous series.
  This change was never upstream and therefore this is not relevant.
- Update the commit message of patch 1/3 of this series, that this commit
  also changes the 'ndashes' to simple dashes. There were no changes, so
  I add the 'Reviewed-by' that the commit received before.
- With this patchset version I have reworked my implementation for the
  evaluation of the additional line state, so that this changes becomes
  smaller. As basis I have used the staged commits from Christian Marangi
  that makes this changes to the netdev trigger. This has already been
  applied to 'for-leds-next-next' by Lee Jones. I adapted this to the
  tty trigger.
  Convert device attr to macro:

  Unify sysfs and state handling:

Changes in v3:
==============
v3: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-leds/20231016071332.597654-1-fe@dev.tdt.de/
- Add missing 'kernel test robot' information to the commit message.
- Additional information added to the commit message

Changes in v2:
==============
v2: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-leds/20230928132632.200263-1-fe@dev.tdt.de/
- rename new function from tty_get_mget() to tty_get_tiocm() as
  requested by 'Jiri Slaby'.
- As suggested by 'Jiri Slaby', fixed tabs in function documentation
  throughout the file '/drivers/tty/tty_io.c' in a separate commit.
- Move the variable definition to the top in function
  'ledtrig_tty_work()'.
  This was reported by the 'kernel test robot' after my change in v1.
- Also set the 'max_brightness' to 'blink_brightness' if no
  'blink_brightness' was set. This fixes a problem at startup when the
  brightness is still set to 0 and only 'line_*' is evaluated. I looked
  in the netdev trigger and that's exactly how it's done there.

Changes in v1:
==============
v1: https://lore.kernel.org/linux-leds/20230926093607.59536-1-fe@dev.tdt.de/
This is a follow-up patchset, based on the mailing list discussion from
March 2023 based on the old patchset v8 [1]. I have changed, the LED
trigger handling via the sysfs interfaces as suggested by Uwe Kleine-KÃ¶nig.
