Write-only is not a problem, right? Nor should be transaction. Just
cache the values in kernel.

Yep, lets ignore that for now.

Yup, this is quite ugly.

What about simply ignoring changes as they happen, and then setting
RGB channels when nothing changes for 10msec?

Take a look at "pattern" trigger. That should give you effect/speed
options. .. for single channel.

Separate patch certainly makes sense.
