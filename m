Hello!

HP EliteBook laptops had dedicated LED for some kind of error and
encryption indication. And there is kernel acpi/wmi driver which can
control this LED. I do not know if recent HP laptops still have these
LEDs, but I would suggest to design API in a way that would allow to use
these dedicated LEDs for their original "vendor" purpose.

I'm mentioning it just because this functionality and design is already
on existing production mainstream laptops, and not something imaginary.

If Linux distributions are still cooperating with laptop vendors and
doing "official" Linux preloads then they may be interested in having
"native" LED functionality support in kernel.
