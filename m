Marek -

I'll try to get a simplified version out as soon as I can.  It will
probably be 3 patches, because I do think that the block subsystem
changes should be in a separate patch.

(I agree that it will be simpler to review - not to mention easier for
me to create.  Past experience does tell me that there are likely some
folks who will object to that format, however.)

I did see that.  I'm a believer in declaring anything that should not
change as const (to the extent that C allows).  It documents the
fact that the value is expected to remain unchanged throughout the
function call, and it enlists the compiler to enforce it.

So while it's true that they aren't necessary, they do result in code
that is at least slightly less likely to be broken by future changes.

Well ... that comment isn't documenting that function.  It's intended to
identify a section of the file whose contents are related.  If there's a
different comment style that I should be using for that purpose, please
let me know.

I'll respond to your other feedback separately.

Thanks for taking your time on this.  I really do appreciate it!
