If you add a driver to mainline kernel you have to think of its all
possible applications to make any prospective users' life easier.

And besides, I was referring to changes of hardcoded color. You
mentioned that color change is unlikely. This indicates that you don't
take into account other applications for this device than your current
board. Such approach is applied for platform drivers where LEDs are
controlled e.g. via MMIO. In this case LED names can be initialized
in a static way. You should look at drivers in arch directory.
I see that some of them include also headers of mfd devices so
it may be your area of interest.

If your device is really bound to this single platform then
this is different discussion.

LED subsystem was founded in 2006 with this naming convention.
Here is an excerpt from the docs touching this issue:

"
There have been calls for LED properties such as color to be exported as
individual led class attributes. As a solution which doesn't incur as much
overhead, I suggest these become part of the device name. The naming scheme
above leaves scope for further attributes should they be needed. If sections
of the name don't apply, just leave that section blank.
"

I was opting for moving color to the sysfs file during LED naming
rework but there was no consensus, so we have to live with that.

All your doubts may stem from the fact that you look at drivers

So this is the gist of the problem - you are platform biased.
The same LED controller can be mounted on various platforms
and may have different functions, which needs to be reflected
in sysfs.

It is not trivial to come up with generic mechanism for registering
sub-LEDs due to various possible iout topologies and arrangements.
