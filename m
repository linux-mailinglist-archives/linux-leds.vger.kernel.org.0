I agree with you completely.
But there was no other hardware to choose it was already on the board.

I just wanted to implement all possibilities features for the chip and
not commit to one. It may be that someone else can use the hardware for
something else. If that is the problem, then I can document that.

Ok I'll try and focus on variant 2.

On my board the LED driver is used for 12 LEDs and 1bit RGB colour 
depth.
So I could select 7 colors and (off).
For my understanding, does this mean that I remove variant 1 from the
source and send a v3 patchset? Or do I have to take anything else into
account when I use variant 2 now?

 From my point of view, the driver should fit if I remove variant 1?

Best regards

Florian
