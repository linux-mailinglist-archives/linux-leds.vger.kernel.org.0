Looks like this option does what you want:

https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/drivers/leds/led-core.c#L578

For this to execute you need to provide init_data when calling
*led_classdev_register*(), omit the; label, function, color_present DT
properties and also init_data's default_label attribute.  At which point
the DT node name should be taken as the LED class name.
