The driver interface was added in "regulator: add PM suspend and resume
hooks".

Ah, that's actually better.  It opens up possiblities for making use of
the feature without encoding voltages in DT.  For example, you can cache
the last however many voltages that were set and jump quickly to them or
do something like put the top of the constraints in to help with
governors like ondemand.  I'd recommend trying for something like that
rather than encoding in DT, it'll probably be more robust with things
like cpufreq changing.
